## Current gate

Token-exact (or ratified distributional) vs pinned vLLM; ≥ throughput and ≤
latency/memory on every axis, both gate models, reproduced 2–3x idle. See
[verification](verification.md). Pin: vLLM `555967922` (0.26.0.dev0).


## Next actions

0. **35B c2/c8 CLOSED by measurement** (`a0fa12c7`): the 0.87x/0.92x "weak
   cells" were a HARNESS MISMATCH. Flat 0.935-0.979x, CoV <0.81%. Next: the
   mid-band ~5% (c2-c16) + the one outlier, TTFT c2 0.872x. The binding harness
   was UNRUNNABLE 2026-08-09..`a0fa12c7` (`vllm-server` rename, 12 stale paths).
1. **27B NVFP4 0.72x -> 0.85x** (FP8 tower native). Next: NVFP4 MLP marlin, 68%
   of roof. Dense-marlin +0.5%; Triton-AOT GDN a WASH.
2. **Spike the Parakeet encoder row** (vLLM: `nano_nemotron_vl.py`; the
   transducer half is NOT in vLLM: separate call).
3. **Qwen3.5-4B sm_120:** GREEN + reprofiled. Spike the residual 1.609x conv
   gap; latency/VRAM and gate models stay open.
2. **Merge the invocation-parity prevention** (CI guard + AGENTS.md checklist);
   CUDA build-verify the byte-exact `kGemvHeuristicAlgos` refactor on dgx.
4. **Restore `local-ai-worker`** on dgx at campaign end (`--restart=always`).
5. **Protocol substrate — partly done.** Triage/audit + `STATUS.md` ratchet +
   `AGENTS.md` tiering DONE. REMAINING: anchor backfill (6 model rows need a
   DECISION); record-era rollover BLOCKED on `DONE` rows bound to
   `parity-ledger.md` LINE anchors (re-anchor by ROW ID).

**Operator/helper protocol** ([spec](workflow.md)): roles are a lock or
worktree+PR; helpers claim `row/<ROW-ID>` with a DRAFT PR. Role/entrypoint gates
ENFORCE `agent-start.py` → claim → preflight. Review FAIL loops through a fresh
implementer until PASS. Queue: 10 rows; backfill 79, 30 anchored.
**Upstream inventory** ([spec](specs/upstream-derived-inventory-2026-08-05.md)):
SM060/061/070 below vLLM's floor = OUT-OF-SCOPE; COMP-*/DISTRIBUTED-* are REAL
unported work; **all 362 archs have rows**; llama.cpp's 11 extra devices IN
SCOPE (`ROAD-V1-D6`).

## Protocol invariants that bite most often

- Every commit carries `FOLLOWING_AGENTS_PROTOCOL` + `Assisted-by:`; never
  `Co-Authored-By` or `Signed-off-by` from AI.
- Three MUST-route seams: fusion, merged-GEMM, born-on-the-runner decode.
  Not routing is drift; allowlist consciously or fold.
- Mirror vLLM; never ask how a feature should behave.
- `nsys` BOTH sides, SAME tool, before any perf claim; cross-tool comparisons
  never establish invocation parity; whole-run sums mix prefill.
- GPU: park `local-ai-worker`, flock `$HOME/gpu.lock`, single-load
  steady-state, never reload per rep, named tmux.
- Never weaken a checker to pass; repair the record.
- Work happens in its own worktree on a task branch; the shared checkout stays
  clean on `main`, never a work surface. Land via `row/*` PR or authorized
  local merge; remove the worktree after.
